#01
#A train arrives at a station uniformly between 8:00 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. Let the
#random variable X represent the number of minutes the train arrives after 8:00
#a.m. What is the probability that the train arrives between 8:10 a.m. and 8:25
#a.m.?
punif(25, min = 0, max = 40, lower.tail = TRUE) - punif(10, min = 0, max = 40, lower.tail = TRUE)

#02
#The time (in hours) to complete a software update is exponentially distributed
#with rate Î» =1/3.Find the probability that an update will take at most 2 hours.
pexp(2, rate = 0.33, lower.tail = TRUE)

#Suppose IQ scores are normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard
#deviation of 15.
#03.1
#What is the probability that a randomly selected person has an IQ
#above 130?
pnorm(130, mean = 100, sd = 15, lower.tail = TRUE)

#03.2
#What IQ score represents the 95th percentile?
qnorm(0.95,mean = 100, sd = 15 )
